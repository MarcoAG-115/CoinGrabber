# CoinGrabber
This project is a client server application which involves path solving, networking, io, and more.

The general design of the application is a blank 2D space populated by static objects that represent coins and dynamic objects that represent players or AI. These dynamic objects will be labeled by the player's name or the AI's assigned name. Players will control their objects with a single input every time they receive a turn. A set number of coins are randomly positioned throughout the space. The players are tasked with navigating the space to collect the most coins. The player will be able to check the number of coins they have collected by viewing the counter positioned in the top right corner of the space. Once all the coins have been collected the game ends and the player with the most coins wins. At the end of the game, the players will be listed from highest score to the lowest score. Along with the previous game results, each player's win / loss information will be updated and displayed.
